'road to life and more '

you can take the road less traveled 

and go on the way you want to go 

there will be reasons you have to find 

as nothing easily goes with flow

you need to learn to find your own way 

and upon reaching there, do have a say 

coz you live only one life to fullest 

so make the most of it come what may 

lead a good life and have your way!
